                <p>HTML and CSS are partners that work together to
                     create web pages. And while they might be team
                      mates, HTML and CSS visually look different,
                       and they function differently too
                     So while you'll have to learn both, it's easy 
                     to learn HTML and CSS togetehr at the same time. They aren't hard.
